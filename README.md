# Data Structure Course Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for my Data Structure course! This repository contains the code and materials for the course, which covers various data structures and algorithms.

Throughout this course, we will explore different data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. We will also learn about algorithms for searching, sorting, and traversing these data structures.

This repository serves as a record of my progress and learning throughout the course. I hope that others may find it useful as a resource for learning about data structures and algorithms.
